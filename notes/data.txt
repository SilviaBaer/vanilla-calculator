/* CORE DATA TYPES

- numbers 1 23 
- strings "", '', ``,
- booleans if ...
- objects {} -> grouped/related data, organize data, key value pair
- Arrays [] -> list data, mix of data types possible
*/

/* SPECIAL VALUES

- undefined: default value of uninitialized vars -> data type
let userName;  
console.log(userName) -> undefined

let userName = "Max";  
console.log(userName) -> "Max"

- null: never assumed by default, used to reset or clear a value -> data type
let userName = null;  
console.log(userName) -> null //resetted!!

- NaN: not a number!! -> not a type, it is a type number and therefore can be used in calcs
3 * "hello" -> NaN 

typeof (checks type of data)//array is just a special type of object
